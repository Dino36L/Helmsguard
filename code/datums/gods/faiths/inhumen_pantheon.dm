	name = "The Tribunal"
	desc = "Three lesser saints, or perhaps greater sinners, make up the Tribunal. \n\
		Those who seek perfection beyond the Six-Pointed-Sun have fallen into several cults of personality, each promising to restore the world in their image or free their adherents from worldly concerns.  \
		Facets-of-gems, blood-stained swords, foul magics manifest; all of these are murmured about by the sheep of the Church and pitiful followers of false Saints. \
		Even to have given up hope is to be prey to their call."
	worshippers = "Warriors, Hedonists, Cultists, Outcasts."
