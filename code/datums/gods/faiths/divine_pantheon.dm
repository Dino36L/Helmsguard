	desc = "The Hexarchy, six ancient elves purporting to be the original children of Anar and Isil, rulers of the now-lost Sun Elves.\n \n\
		Viewed as exemplars of their specific virtues, many elves emulate a chosen patron while guarding themselves against the excesses these saints avoided in their trials.\n\
		Other elves strive for balance in the Six-Pointed Star, believing this the true path to enlightenment.\n\
		Human worship among the Tyrian Empire elevates these beings to the state of not only immortal beings, but proper deities, capable of providing oracles. These 'gods' are ever-fickle to men, however, and often prayers seem unanswered."
