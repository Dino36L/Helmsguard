	name = "Shepherdism"
	desc = "The Church of The Lamb, in whom mortals trust their immortal souls.\n \n\
		A faith from the distant east that arose from slaves and now annoints kings; its spread through the minds of mortals and even some elves is its own miracle. \n\
		While the world says the strong do as they will and the weak suffer what they must, the Shepherdist believes the strong must do for the weak as the Shepherd for the Lamb. \n\
		The Eislers are the strongest adherents, having the prophetic words of the Lamb preached to them by a Zhan-Khazad missionary as they first passed over the Zium-Kheled Mountains into the lands now called Sundmark."
	
	worshippers = "Almost all Eislers and some other humans, few elves and dwarves, protective and repentant souls."
