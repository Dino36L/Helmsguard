    <h1>Helmsguard Server Rules</h1>
    <p class="note">Please note that nothing is set in stone and the rules are still subject to change at this stage.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Rule Enforcement</strong><br>
            Admins have the final say in interpreting and enforcing the rules. Roleplay is the heart of this server, and admins may set aside other rules if it benefits the player experience. Admins may also intervene during rounds to protect the community and keep gameplay enjoyable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Don’t Be a Dick</strong><br>
            Be excellent to each other. We’re here to have fun together, not to ruin each other’s experience. Being a jerk in-character is fine within reason, but being a jerk out-of-character is not.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Don’t Use Out-of-Character Knowledge In-Game (Metagaming)</strong><br>
            Play the game fairly—don’t use information from outside the game (like Discord or voice chats) to gain an unfair advantage. Characters may know general game mechanics and can maintain persistent friendships or relationships, but they should not collaborate in ways that have no in-character justification.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>This Is a Roleplaying Server</strong><br>
            Keep in-character (IC) and out-of-character (OOC) separate. Your words and actions should reflect your character, not the player behind the screen. Ignoring roleplay opportunities may result in administrative action. For OOC chat or clarifications, use the LOOC chat (shortcut key “L” or the OOC tab).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Antagonist Rules</strong><br>
            Antagonists are largely free to pursue their goals using any means, except:
            <ul>
                <li>- Metagaming or metacomms</li>
                <li>- Exploiting bugs</li>
                <li>- ERP or creepy/explicit content</li>
                <li>- Mixing IC/OOC</li>
                <li>- Spawn-camping</li>
            </ul>
            Players may not preemptively hunt or interfere with antagonists without valid IC reason. If you act like an antagonist, others may treat you as one. Team antagonists should not sabotage their own team’s efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vital Job Roles</strong><br>
            Key roles (e.g. Castellan, Steward, Hand, Knight, Chaptermaster, Bailiff) shape the round’s flow and are held to a higher standard. Admins will monitor these roles more closely.<br>
            Players in these roles should avoid isolating themselves in private RP for most of the round. Doing so may result in job bans or PQ penalties.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Admin Decisions Are Final</strong><br>
            Admins’ in-game rulings are binding. If you feel an admin has acted unfairly, you can bring it up on Discord. Admins are not required to share IC details or investigations with you. Lying to admins in adminhelps will be dealt with harshly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not skirt around the rules</strong><br>
            If you repeatedly toe the line without outright breaking a rule, admins will treat it as if you did. Repeated rulebreaking or baiting others into rulebreaking will result in harsher consequences.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Age Requirement</strong><br>
            You must be at least 18 years old to play here. If suspected of being underage, you’ll need to privately show a photo ID (with your photo, name, and address censored) to an admin. Failure to comply will result in a permanent ban. If you are found to be underage, you will also be permanently banned.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Losing Is Part of the Game</strong><br>
            Your character may die unexpectedly or face challenges beyond your control. Accept that losing is a natural part of the game and story. No deaths are truly canon. Permanent deaths are strictly under the discretion of the player of the character only.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No OOC Bigotry</strong><br>
            Out-of-character discrimination against real-world characteristics (race, sex, gender, disability, orientation, etc.) is strictly prohibited.<br>
            This includes all IRL slurs, which are banned both IC and OOC.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ERP (Erotic Roleplay)</strong><br>
            ERP is allowed but not the server’s main focus. ERP is an extension of roleplay, not its centerpiece.
            <ul>
                <li>- Keep ERP private—use secluded areas or appropriate spaces so others aren’t exposed to it without consent.</li>
                <li>- ERP can be interrupted by antagonists, the law, or other IC conflicts. Don’t use ERP to avoid IC consequences.</li>
                <li>- If you’re in a vital role (antag, leadership, or combat roles), your job takes priority over ERP. Neglecting duties for ERP can result in job bans or PQ penalties.</li>
                <li>- Consensual Non-Consent (CNC) ERP is only allowed on non-defiant characters (check if a character “looks defiant”). Players must toggle “be defiant” in the character creator (it’s on by default) if they do not consent to CNC ERP.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No Metagrudging or OOC Harassment</strong><br>
            Do not target a player repeatedly in different rounds because of OOC grudges or past IC events. This includes bullying, harassing, or singling them out in OOC or IC due to player identity rather than character actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Combat and Escalations</strong><br>
            There are no strict escalation rules. Players may approach conflict differently—some may rush in, others may prefer to roleplay their approach. Use your discretion and adapt to the style of those around you.<br>
            <strong>Typing Indicator Respect:</strong> Pay attention to the typing indicator (the “...” speech bubble). Give players a chance to emote or respond before attacking.<br>
            Don’t exploit the Typing Indicator by:
            <ul>
                <li>- Attacking players while their indicator is active to catch them off guard.</li>
                <li>- Using it to avoid confrontation (e.g. attacking or running away while typing).</li>
            </ul>
            You’re not required to emote every sword swing, but if you plan to remove a player from the round, provide some IC context for the escalation (unless you’re an antagonist).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rounds Are Non-Canon</strong><br>
            Each round is a self-contained story with a beginning, escalation, and climax.<br>
            Characters may change jobs, skills, or builds from round to round. Maintain some consistency in personality, but experimentation is welcome—just keep it believable.<br>
            Relationships persist only if both players agree. Specific details (like a previous betrayal) should be kept private or handled discreetly.<br>
            No metagrudging between rounds. Suspicion is fine, but don’t pursue revenge from one round to the next unless both players agree to it.<br>
            Avoid consistently betraying or lying to the same players round after round unless it’s an agreed rivalry. Otherwise, this can lead to meta-grudging and admin intervention.
