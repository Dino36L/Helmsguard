<b>It is the 3416th year since Anno Nihil, when an eclipse took Anar and Isil from their Elven domain.</b> Some dare call this the Age of Mortals...
<br>
<br>
Thousands of years ago, the War of Brothers tore the Court of Saints into three Successor Houses, the Bright Elves of Calarost, the Dawn Elves of Beroth, and the Sylvan Elves of Saeran. 
<br>
But when the Tyrian tribes of Man came into his forest realms, Saeran people were scattered. Now his Lady weeps amid the gloaming realm.
<br>
<br>
The Zium-Khazad and Zhan-Khazad are two collections of fortress-states, one huddled in the ice-capped mountains of the north and the other sprawling in the cliffs of the southern deserts, trapping seasonal rains in great stonework basins. When the Eisler tribes first passed by the Zium-Khazaden gates they were all shut to them; the dwarves fearing the same betrayal the Tyrians had dealt the Sylvan Elves a millennia before. It was only the pleas of a Zhan-Khazaden philosopher, travelling the mountain passes with a human band caught in early snowstorms, that convinced the gatekeep to allow the refugees within. That winter, the teachings of Shepherdism spread to this new fair-haired warrior tribe and the path of Eisler civilization forever changed.

The Tyrian Empire is vast, their ships carrying armored legions to any shore of the warm southern sea. Their great houses, comprised of those chieftains who took to wife Sylvan elves, are all of half-elven blood. Long-lived leaders lay far-sighted plans, and few wars have been launched without decades of patient schemes. Still, the half-elven blood diminishes with each generation, and rulers grow shorter-lived and more impatient to earn their triumphal laurels. Some even say the Empire's legates may turn their swords inward if they do not break their truce with the Eislers first.
<br>
<br>
The Holy Eisler Confederation spread across the northern forests not a millennium ago, turning a trackless wilderness that froze and swallowed legions into hard-won farmland and walled fortresses. Trade with the Zium-Khazad was the key; the bounty of the lowlands was exchanged for the forge's children until the dwarves grew fat and men had hides of iron. The chieftains styled themselves 'Graf' and elected their wisest to reign as King. Lesser warriors pledged their swords and became knights and upholders of the common peace.
<br>
When the Tyrian legions came to subjugate this new neighbor the battle raged across the Sundmark. Biding time for the Confederation to marshal its armies, the Markgraf was slain in battle without an heir, and since then a Lord Castellan has been appointed for the vital fortress of the Sundburg.
<br>
Yet the truce was struck and sworn in blood and iron; the armies of the two nations may yet grow old before slaying fellow-man in war again, Shepherd willing.
<br>
<br>
The Bright Elves view the world as the paradise they create, seeking no higher aspiration than immortal, languid bliss while lesser beings do their toil.
<br>
The Dawn Elves see the world as a dim shadow they do not yet comprehend, seeking to attain perfection in knowledge and prowess to build paradise in their immortality.
<br>
The Gloam Elves ever held the mortal world cheaply, and suffered greiviously at the hands of Man. Only perfecting the soul and spirit might prepare them for the death they know comes to all.
<br>
<b>Yet if Anar's wisdom and Isil's love is gone, and we are in the Twilight of our race; perhaps there is a darker path...</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>The wizard's circle; one cannot leave so long as they believe the Illusion.</b>
