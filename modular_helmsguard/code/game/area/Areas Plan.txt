We will organize areas into commented headers for our own logical convenience.

Sundmark's geography lends itself to ringed domains and areas will reflect that.

The principle concern of areas is warhorn alarm reports being informative.
The secondary concern of areas is sound design and lighting.
The tertriary concern of areas is admin logs being more readable at a glance than XY coords.
	That is, a review of the logs should quickly show if someone's in a secure area or running from a confrontation.

All roof/sky needs some windy ambiance that is uniform across all types.

Put a star to prioritize the most important things to make NOW and expand out the details when you have time.
